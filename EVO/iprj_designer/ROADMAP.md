# Roadmap — iprj Designer

Six rounds of work are complete and archived in [[DESIGN_HISTORY.md]], not
listed here anymore: the Phase 1 MVP (Sessions 1–7 — data model, drawing
core, attributes, templates, centerline placement), a second "Phase 1–4"
round (quick wins/file management, domain accuracy, the toolbar/multi-select
overhaul, and the advanced template engine), a third numbered-items round
(Items 1–9 and 11 — background-tool rework, per-zone-type conditions,
sensor management, edit-mode/vertex tools, terminology renames, free-draw
polygons, centerline re-stationing, canonical origin, and the multi-sensor
2-file split), a fourth "owner batch" round (Items 12–20 — quick UI
fixes, the template-editor taxonomy rename + even spacing + side-by-side
adjacency table, centerline placement snap/naming, and the large-file
zoom-freeze fix), a fifth "annotation-ownership" round (Items 21–22 —
sensor-scoped lineals/centerlines/labels via vendor index bands, plus the
text-label GUI entity + centerline-name labels), and a sixth "Draw-hub
consolidation" round (Items 23–27, 2026-07-07 — toolbar planning + mockups,
the Draw-hub toolbar consolidation with a unified owner/sensor dropdown, the
oversized off-image canvas, bulk-edit + explicit persisted centerline
membership, and folding Template into Draw › Event Zone under one CL dropdown;
plus post-batch UI fixes on 2026-07-08 — a full-height flex layout so the page
fits the window, a wider zone table, and the ruler exiting on tool selection).
Reusing "Phase 1" for two unrelated rounds is exactly the confusion this file
is now organized to avoid — see the note below.

Work below is broken into **named, numbered items** instead of sequential
phases:
- The number is a **stable ID**, assigned once when an item is added and
  never reused or renumbered — not an execution sequence. An item's
  number doesn't change if items above/below it are finished and removed,
  or if the list gets reordered.
- **File order is priority order** (with prerequisites noted inline where
  one item depends on another), read top to bottom. Reordering the file
  doesn't touch the numbers.
- Each item carries a **Target** model per [[CLAUDE.md]]'s routing and a
  **Suggested prompt**. Default is **Opus, end-to-end in one session**
  (plan + implement + tests + docs, no cross-model hand-off); Sonnet is an
  option for a whole small mechanical item; Fable is a debugging escalation
  only. See CLAUDE.md's "Model routing / division of labor" for the full
  rule. (Older completed items — now archived — used a "Fable then
  Sonnet" hand-off that this routing has retired.)
- Tell the agent "do Item N of ROADMAP.md" (or reference it by name) to run
  a scope below; check off items and log decisions in [[DESIGN_HISTORY.md]]
  as they land, the same way every round so far has.

"Future" items at the bottom aren't scoped yet (no Target/Scope/prompt) —
they need a planning pass before they're actionable.

## 10 — Webserver Deployment (Target: Opus)

Carried over unchanged from the earlier "Phase 5" round (not started, not
dropped). Big enough that its planning half may still warrant its own
session before the implementation, but both halves are Opus now — no
cross-model hand-off.

Scope:
- [ ] Decide how per-user/project state is isolated across concurrent
      NiceGUI sessions.
- [ ] Decide project file management approach (server-side open/save vs.
      upload/download) and whether auth is in scope.
- [ ] Output a plan for the implementation pass — this half is a decision
      document, not code.
- [ ] Implement the plan: multi-session safety, project file management,
      harden NiceGUI serving for other users.
- [ ] Packaging (`pip install` entry point or container).

Suggested prompt:
> [Opus] In EVO/iprj_designer, plan Item 10 of ROADMAP.md: design
> multi-session state isolation for the NiceGUI app, a project file
> management approach (server-side vs. upload/download), and whether auth
> is in scope. Land the plan first (decision document, no code), then
> implement it in a following session.

## Future (not yet scoped)

- Display objects from a live stream.
- Upload and play back a recorded playback file.
- Integrate the line-up/calibrate workflow (see
  `~/pyatspm/src/atspm/video/calibrate.py`) more directly into the app.
